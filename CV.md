Other Projects

### CouchDB Core Committer
Based on broad experience with CouchDB, I was asked to become a part of the Apache Software foundation to be a core CouchDB committer. This was an honour to be asked to be involved with a great team of high quality developers. Recently I have been asked to join the 'Couch-Firm' which supports couchdb in real world.

### Garden20

http://garden20.com

I developed this open source app framework based on couchdb. It is being used by medic mobile, and various other groups to make a white lable app store that their customers can install and upgrade suites of applications.

### Jam

http://jamjs.org/

Like componentjs, or bower, jam is an easy way to manage javascript dependencies. It makes it easy to compile down all application assets into one loadable js file. Now I support the community and send patches to many js libraries to better integrate with requirejs modules, and jam.
